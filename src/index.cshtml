        Provides a number of repositories that contain all the necessary code to create a
        build environment either in the cloud or on-prem. All infrastructure resources
        are based on the idea of
        <a href="https://thenewstack.io/a-brief-look-at-immutable-infrastructure-and-why-it-is-such-a-quest/">immutable infrastructure</a>.

            <h3 class="section__title">Infrastructure as code</h3>
            <p>
                All infrastructure resources can be created from
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_Code">scripts and configuration files</a>
                which are stored in source control thereby ensuring that all changes are tracked and
                standard software development processes can be applied to the infrastructure resources.

                The resources are designed to be created and configured once. Any changes to the
                resource code will create a new resource. That way the new resource can be tested
                and then be used to replace the old resource. If any issues still appear with the
                new resource then the old one can be activated again in a quick roll-back process
            </p>

            <h3 class="section__title">Automated builds</h3>
            <p>
                All resources can be created with a standard build system. That way the resources
                can be build using the same tooling as the applications. Thus providing fast feedback
                and repeatable results.
