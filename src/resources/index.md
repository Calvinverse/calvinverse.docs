This section describes the different resources that the Calvinverse project provides.
The description contains information about the capabilities that a resource provide,
which tools and services are part of the resource, how the resource can be build,
how the resource should be deployed and what external services the resource expects
to find in the environment into which it is deployed.

To simplify reasoning about the different resources they are divided into three
different categories:

- [Base resources](category-base.html) - These resources provide the base upon which
  other resources are based. In general base resources are not useful by themselves.
- [Pipeline resources](category-pipeline.html) - These resources provide the build pipeline capabilities
  for the environment.
- [Supporting resources](category-support.html) - The supporting resources provide enhancements
  for the environment in which the pipeline resources are running. Examples of this kind of resource
  are the observability resources, e.g. [logging](category-observability-logs.html) and
  [metrics](category-observability-metrics.html).
