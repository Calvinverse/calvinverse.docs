Over the last few months I have been working on the documentation for Calvinverse. The first set
of changes is now up. It includes a new and hopefully better theme and layout and documentation
pages that explain how to get started with Calvinverse.

The following pages may be of interest

* [Getting started](../documentation/getting-started.html) - Explains how to get started with the
  Calvinverse resources.
* [Environments](../documentation/environments.html) - Explains what an environment is from the
  perspective of the Calvinverse resources.
* [Configuration](../documentation/configuration.html) - Explains how to configure the Calvinverse
  resources once you have created an environment.
* [Setup](../documentation/setup.html) - How to setup an environment with the Calvinverse
  resources.

I hope these pages will be useful. Enjoy.
